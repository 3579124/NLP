# Course Projects – NLP & Large Language Models

This repository contains all projects completed for the course, covering key topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).
Each notebook focuses on a specific subject and includes explanations, experiments, and runnable code.

### Covered Subjects

The projects include:
  1. Introduction maths optimisation
  2.  Hello World Transformers
  3.  Transformer_text_classification
  4.  NLP Clustering and Topic Modeling
  5.  Text classification with Generative Models
  6.  Understanding_Tokenization_and_Embeddings_for_LLMs

### Repository Structure

Each project is organized as a standalone Jupyter Notebook, with:
- Conceptual explanations (Markdown)
- Executable code cells
- Example outputs and analysis
Some notebooks are designed to be run locally, while others are optimized for Google Colab and include links for direct execution.

### Execution Notes

Google Colab is recommended for notebooks that require GPU acceleration or specific environments.
All notebooks have been re-run to ensure reproducibility before submission.
Public links are provided where required for grading and review.
