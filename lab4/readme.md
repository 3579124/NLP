## NLP Clustering and Topic Modeling Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically text clustering and topic modeling.
The notebook walks through preprocessing text data, extracting features, applying unsupervised learning methods, and interpreting the resulting clusters and topics.

### Execution Environment

This notebook was developed and executed using Google Colab.

To ensure everything runs correctly (libraries, versions, GPU/CPU behavior), please open the notebook via the Google Colab link below rather than running it locally.

Access the notebook on Google Colab:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kUh3DfzaqhBFlHdoW0SCQNatCHWfdBvy

Local execution is possible but may require additional dependency installation and environment configuration.

### What This Notebook Covers

The notebook includes:

Text cleaning and preprocessing

Vectorization techniques (e.g. TF-IDF or embeddings)

Clustering methods for unlabeled text data

Topic modeling to extract latent themes

Visualization and interpretation of results

### Requirements

All dependencies are handled directly within Google Colab.

If you choose to run this notebook locally, you may need:

Python 3.x

NumPy, pandas

scikit-learn

NLP libraries (such as NLTK, spaCy, or similar, depending on the notebook)

Jupyter Notebook

### How to Use

Open the Google Colab link above.

Save a copy to your own Google Drive.

Run the notebook cells from top to bottom.

Review outputs and adjust parameters to explore different clustering or topic modeling results.

### Notes

Results may vary depending on random initialization and parameter choices.

This notebook is intended for educational and experimental purposes.
