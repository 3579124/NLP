Transformer Text Classification Notebook  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates text classification using a Transformer-based model.  
The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, model setup, training, and evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow.  

Important Note on Execution Environment  

This notebook was developed and tested using Google Colab.  
To ensure full compatibility and avoid environment or dependency issues, please open and run the notebook using the Colab link below.
