## Text Classification with Generative Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores text classification using generative language models.
The notebook demonstrates how generative models can be adapted for classification tasks, including data preprocessing, prompt or model setup, inference, and evaluation.

### Execution Environment
This notebook was developed and run using Google Colab.
To avoid dependency issues and ensure consistent results, it is strongly recommended to open and run this notebook in Google Colab rather than locally.
Running the notebook locally may require additional configuration and library installation.

📂 Notebook Overview

The notebook includes:

Text preprocessing and dataset handling

Using generative models for classification tasks

Prompt-based or model-based classification logic

Evaluation of classification results

Discussion of model behavior and limitations

⚙️ Requirements

All required libraries are handled within Google Colab.

If running locally, you may need:

Python 3.x

PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model used)

Hugging Face Transformers

NumPy, pandas

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook using the Google Colab link.

(Optional) Save a copy to your own Google Drive.

Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom.

Review outputs and experiment with model settings or prompts.

📝 Notes

Results may vary depending on model choice, prompt design, and randomness.

This notebook is intended for learning and experimentation rather than production use.
